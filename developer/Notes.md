# Notes During Learning
## Creating an Android Project
### Activities
An activity is one of the distinguishing features of the Android framework.
Activities provide the user with access to your app, and there may be many activities.
An application will usually have a main activity for when the user launches the application,
another activity for when she selects some content to view, for example, and other activities 
for when she performs other tasks within the app.
